# The TLDR Guide of Fixing Shutdown/Restart

This guide is a simplified version the section of Fixing Shutdown/Restart found in Dortania's OpenCore Post-Install Guide.  
I wrote this guide  because I could not understand the steps in the original guide as they where written. It took me a lot of time, frusrtation, and trial-and-error to finally figure it out. This is a combination of personal notes (in case I ever need to do this procedure again) and reference for others who have the same issue understanding the original guide.
